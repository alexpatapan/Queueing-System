# Queueing-System
A Python based GUI application functioning as a database of names ordered in time since entered.

This application was created in request to satisfy a growing need in my univeristy classes for a universal queue system for student questions. This allows students to enter their name and wait for tutors to orderly go down the ordered list. It removes the need for students to put up their hand, allowing them to attend to other matters whilst simultaneously queuing. Students are ordered first by the number of questions they have asked in a session, then by the time since their last question. While queueing, students may also play a game of tic-tac-toe which is integrated into the system, with the extended options to customize the colour of tiles.
